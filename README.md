# SyntaxHighlighter Reloaded

This is the default syntax highlighting theme from [SyntaxHighlighter package by Alex Gorbatchev](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter) converted from the [TextMate](https://github.com/unitmatrix/sublime-syntaxhighlighter)
theme using the [TextMate bundle converter](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-theme) and adapted to be used in Atom text editor mainly for PHP, HTML, JavaScript, XML and other languages syntax highlighting.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. The current theme is almost identical to the original package with minimal changes and adaptations to Atom text editor highlighting rules.
